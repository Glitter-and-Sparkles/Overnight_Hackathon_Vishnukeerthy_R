Problem Statement:-

Educational institutions often struggle to:

*Identify sudden changes in student behavior

*Detect patterns that may indicate stress, academic decline, or misconduct

*Provide early intervention before issues escalate

*Traditional monitoring systems are manual, time-consuming, and inaccurate.

*There is a need for an automated, data-driven behavioral scoring system that can highlight anomalies in real time.


Our Solution:-

Integritty automatically analyzes behavioral data and generates:

✔️ Behavior Scores

Each student receives a score based on their recorded activity, interactions, or inputs.

✔️ Anomaly Detection
The system flags unusual patterns such as:
*Sudden drops in performance

*Inconsistent attendance

*Irregular submission patterns

*Deviations from the student’s historical behavior

✔️ Clean, Simple Dashboard
The Flask-based interface displays:

*Student behavior score

*Activity logs

*Alerts for anomalies
